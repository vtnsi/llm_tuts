1,The access matrix approach to protection has the difficulty that,"the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage",it is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements,deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable,there is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself,A,A,Correct

Which of the following sets of integers could possibly be the set of all common divisors of two integers?,"{-6,-2, -1, 1, 2, 6}","{-6, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6}","{-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6}","{-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6}",C,C,Correct
3,"In the NoNicks operating system, the time required by a single file-read operation has four nonoverlapping components:
disk seek time-25 msec
disk latency time-8 msec
disk transfer time- 1 msec per 1,000 bytes
operating system overhead-1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec
In version 1 of the system, the file read retrieved blocks of 1,000 bytes. In version 2, the file read (along with the underlying layout on disk) was modified to retrieve blocks of 4,000 bytes. The ratio of-the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1 is approximately",1:4,1:3.5,1:1,1.1:1,B,B,Correct

5,Any set of Boolean operators that is sufficient to represent all Boolean expressions is said to be complete. Which of the following is NOT complete?,"{AND, NOT}","{NOT, OR}","{AND, OR}",{NAND},C,C,Correct
6,"Consider the collection of all undirected graphs with 10 nodes and 6 edges. Let M and m, respectively, be the maximum and minimum number of connected components in any graph in the collection. If a graph has no selfloops and there is at most one edge between any pair of nodes, which of the following is true?","M = 10, m = 10","M = 10, m = 1","M = 7, m = 4","M = 6, m = 4",B,C,Incorrect
7,"Resolution theorem proving for showing that a formula of propositional logic is not satisfiable has which of the following properties?
I. It is a sound proof system in the sense that there does not exist a proof of the unsatisfiability of a satisfiable formula of propositional logic.
II. It is a complete proof system in the sense that there is a proof of unsatisfiability for every unsa tisfiable formula of propositional logic.
III. It is a succinct proof system in the sense that whenever an unsatisfiable formula F of propositional logic has a resolution proof, F also has a proof whose length is polynomial in the length of F.",I only,III only,I and II only,I and III only,A,C,Incorrect
8,"Which of the following statements describe(s) properties of a purely segmented memory system?
I. It divides memory into units of equal size.
II. It permits implementation of virtual memory.
III. It suffers from internal fragmentation.",I only,II only,III only,I and III,A,B,Incorrect
9,Which of the following statements about floating-point arithmetic is NOT true?,It is inherently nonassociative because some numbers have no exact representation.,It is inherently nonassociative because there have to be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers.,Associativity can be achieved with appropriate roundoff conventions.,Some rational numbers have no exact representation.,B,C,Incorrect
10,"Suppose sharing of tiles in a multilevel directory structure is achieved with directory entries that are links pointing to a node containing information about a shared file. Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file. What is a primary drawback to this approach to sharing?","If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes.","If the owner renames the file, other users will not be able to access it.","If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.","If any user who shares the file appends to it, others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks.",C,C,Correct
11,"Mergesort works by splitting a list of n numbers in half, sorting each half recursively, and merging the two halves. Which of the following data structures will allow mergesort to work in O(n log n) time?
I. A singly linked list
II. A doubly linked list
III. An array",None,III only,I and II only,"I, II, and III",B,D,Incorrect
12,"If p(x) is the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial for the real-valued function f(x) at the n + 1 distinct real numbers x0, .... xn what is the maximum possible degree of p(x)?",n,n + 1,n + 2,2n,A,A,Correct
13,"An internal hash table has 5 buckets, numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Keys are integers, and the hash function h(i) = i mod 5 is used, with linear resolution of collisions (i.e., if bucket h(i) is filled, the buckets h(i) + 1, h(i) + 2, ... are tried successively with all bucket numbers computed modulo 5). If elements with keys 13, 8, 24, 10, and 3 are inserted, m that order, into an initially blank hash table, then the content of the bucket numbered 2 is",3,8,10,13,C,A,Incorrect
